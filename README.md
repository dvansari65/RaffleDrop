# RaffleDrop 


🎯 Overview

LuckyBid is a decentralized raffle-style marketplace where anyone can sell real-world or digital products, and buyers participate for a chance to win them at a fraction of the cost. Once the minimum funding goal (tickets sold) is met, a verifiably-random winner is selected using Switchboard VRF — ensuring fairness, transparency, and zero-trust execution on the Solana blockchain.

✨ Key Features

💰 Seller Guarantee: Sellers receive the full selling price when the raffle concludes successfully
🎟️ Affordable Participation: Buyers pay only a small entry fee for a chance to win high-value items
⚖️ Provably Fair Selection: Winners are chosen using verifiable on-chain randomness (Switchboard VRF)
📜 Smart-Legal Contracts: Optional legally-binding agreements prevent sellers from listing products elsewhere
🔒 Secure Escrow: All funds are held in Program Derived Address (PDA) vaults until conditions are met
